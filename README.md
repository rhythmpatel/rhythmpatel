I am a UI/UX Designer and Front-end Developer with 12+ years of experience.
Currently working with **Noovosoft**.

My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning - React / React Native / Shopify

ðŸ”­ I am trying to build a pool of free HTML/CSS blocks in Bootstrap, Foundation and Tailwind CSS and other web design and development related resources -
