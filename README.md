I am a UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer with 14+ years of experience.
<br>Currently working as UI/UX Designer + Senior Frontend Developer with **Liventus**.

My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.
